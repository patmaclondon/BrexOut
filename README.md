# BrexOut
Simple Sprite Kit app in Xcode and OS X to get the hang of it...
This is how far I got 
I'm trying to port an iphone lesson game to OS X, problem is that the paddle once you press the arrow key stops once and then flows.
It's just a Breakout game to get to grips with Spritekit and Swift in OS X and Xcode
